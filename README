UCN storage simulation blatantly copied from "ExUCN" in examples/extended in
Geant4.10.04.p01. Later, in gunmessenger branch, had to reinstall
Geant4.10.06.p01. This broke things a little, so now working with latest version
of Geant4. This version also had updated/working ucn example.

 1- GEOMETRY

     World: G4Box           - 1m x 1m x 1m
     Storage Cell: 3 G4Tubs - hollow cylinder 500mm long x 90mm ID x 2 mm
                              thick

     The storage cell wall is made of G4_Ni with a fake loss factor two orders
     of magnitude larger than in nickel.

     "REFLECTIVITY" = 1
     // "DIFFUSION" = 0.1 (set to zero)
     "FERMIPOT" = 252.0 neV
     "SPINFLIP"= 0.
     // "LOSS" = 12.5e-5 (set to 1e-2)
     "LOSSCS" = 0.
     "ABSCS"= 4.49    // 1/v loss cross-section  at room temp.
     "SCATCS" = 18.5  // (incoherent) "elastic" scattering cross-section

     // MicroRoughness option disabled
     // The MicroRoughnessParameters are:

     // Roughness correlation length w = 30nm
     // Surface roughness b = 1nm
     // # of angles theta_i in the look-up tables: 180
     // # of energie bins in the look-up tables: 1000
     // min. and max. values of theta_i: 0*degree and 90*degree
     // min. and max values of Energy: 1neV and 1000neV
     // # of angles theta_o in the look-up table calculation: 15
     // # of angels phi_o   in the look-up table calculation: 15
     // angular cut: 0.01*degree

     The default step limits in the vacuum is 1mm and maxTime is DBL_MAX

     The simulation is in a G4UniformGravityField

 2- PHYSICS LIST

    The ExUCNPhysicsList defines only G4Neutron, G4Proton, G4Electron,
    G4AntiNeutrinoE, G4MuonPlus, G4MuonMinus and G4GenericIon.

    Through ExUCNExtraPhysics the following processes are instantiated:

    G4StepLimiter
    G4UserSpecialCuts

    and in ConstructUCN()

    G4UCNLoss
    G4UCNAbsorption
    G4UCNMultiScattering

 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR

     The primary kinematic consists of a single ultra-cold neutron. The default
     value is 10neV. User can change this via /gun/gunEnergyneV <value in neV>.
     Spawns at center of storage cell in random 4*pi steradians.

 4- VISUALIZATION

     The Visualization Manager is set in the main() for interactive session.
     In interactive mode,
       /control/execute vis.mac
     is run automatically.

 5- HOW TO START ?

   % mkdir build
   % cd build
   % cmake ../
   % make

   For interactive mode:
   % ./ExUCN

   For batch mode:
   % ./ExUCN ExUCN.in > ExUCN.out

 6- DATA

    UCN "alive times" (how long particle exists in simulation before loss) are
    output to G4cout.
