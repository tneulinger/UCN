DPE:
  * Density: Average PE density roughly 0.92 g/cm3. Replace H->D gives approximately
    density -> (mass DPE)/(mass PE)*density = (16/14)*0.92 = 1.05 g/cm3.
  * Fermi potential and loss: Appl. Phys. Lett. 107, 121604 (2015); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4931388
  * Bulk cross sections are wrong!
